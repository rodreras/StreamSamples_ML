    "In geochemistry analysis, one of the main components of general error in exploration operations is laboratory error, and obtaining this error is important to know the precision of the analysis. Since, in regional-scale geochemical projects, the goal is to measure the relative values of each element corresponding to each other for finding promising areas, hence the precision of measurements is more important than their accuracy."
