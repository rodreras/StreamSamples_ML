    "**Objective**: Prediction/Interpolation of elemental concentrations\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1 Data Collection\n",
    "\n",
    "The data was collected from the Brazilian Geological Survey (CPRM) in the folder of the [Destrito Zincífero de Vazante, Minas Gerais (MG), Brasil](https://rigeo.cprm.gov.br/handle/doc/19397) (_Zinc-enriched District of Vazante, Minas Gerais State, Brazil_), acronym `DZV`. The stream sediments dataset was requested by e-mail to CPRM and promptly made available.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset that will be explored is the Stream Sediments Geochemical Samples from DZV, which is a program that has been conducted in the northwest region of Minas Gerais State, Brazil, published in 2017 to aid exploration and development of mineral industry focused on **Zinc ore**. \n",
    "\n",
    "`Stream sediments` are sediment samples collected from a stream, river or water body. It consists in the product of physical and chemical weathering over rocks, that end up in the dreinage channel caried by surface runoff (Rose et al, 1979). Such material is fundamental for the targeting of mineral ore body, and it has been used for thousand years by humankind (Ottesen and Theobald, 1994, Doherty et al, 2023).\n",

    "### 1.2 Meaning of the Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Context\n",
    "\n",
    "The `DZV` lies within the Brasília Belt, more specifically in the center-south part (Almeida, 1967 & 1968).  This geological terrain was formed in the Brasiliano Cycle, during the Neoproterozoic period (1Ga to 500Ma), when the cratons of São Francisco, Amazonas, and Paranapanema collided. This collision was one of many that created the big southern paleocontinent Gondwana. (Valeriano et al., 2004; Pimentel et al., 2011).\n",
    "\n",
    "Cratons are characterized as a solid and stable part of the continental lithosphere. Due to its light density when compared to the ocean crust, the cratons can resist the movements of the tectonic plates, such as rifts and subductions. As a consequence, these resistant pieces of rocks are commonly found in the middle of tectonic plates and continents (Petit, 2010). Figure 1 shows the main cratons of South America and Africa when these continents were joined in the super paleocontinent Pangea.\n",

    "\n",
    "The shock of these Brazilian cratons led to the Brasilia Belt (Figure 2) as stated above. This collision generated 3 geological compartments of the folding belt: the Inner Zone, the External Zone, and the Cratonic Domain. Since the area of interest (AOI) is located in the External Zone, that is where we are focusing - highlighted by the purple box in Figure 2. \n",

The stream sediments are located in the region of the purple draw square, in the cities of Paracatu, Vazante, and Coromandel. Source: Valeriano, 2016.*|\n",
    "\n",
    "The `DZV` is located in the External Zone of Brasília Belt. The main mineralizations of Zn are within the Vazante Group (Dias et al., 2015). In Geology, a group is a grouping of geologic formations. Each formation is characterized by a couple of lithologies. Within Vazante Group, there are in total 3 Formations: Lapa Fm, Serra do Poço, and Morro do Calcário Fm, Serra do Garrote Fm. They are always displayed from the youngest to the oldest, as shown in Figure 3. Groups and formations are classified according to the similarities between the lithologies, being different from rock bodies in the surroundings, and that also occupies a particular position in the layers of rock exposed in a geographical region (Boggs, 1987).\n",

    "\n",

    "In total, in the `DZV`, there are 6 mines extracting Zn-ore, mainly by the mineral willemite (Zn2SiO4 - Zinc Silicate). In some areas, the concentration of Zn can reach 8000 ppm (Dias et al., 2015).  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "With the whole background in mind, the objective of this project is to find, with the aid of Machine Learning regression algorithms, prospectable areas rich in Zn based on the stream sediment samples collected in the `DZV`. Due to the 1st law of Geography, where \"everything is related to everything, but near things are more related than distant things\"; and due to the geological setting of the region, it is expected that the Zn-rich areas are located in the eastern part of the grid of stream sediment samples.\n"
